# CS 4220 Computer Networks Project 1
These programs were written for CS 4220 Computer Networks at UCCS Spring 2020

## Compilation
- There is a make file included in this directory. To compile the files omit the extension and use the comand `make compile(fileNameNoExtension)`
- Ex. `make compile1.1` will compile 1.1.cpp in this project.
- This will make an executable in the current directory named 1.1, 1.2, or 2 depending on which one you want to run
- You can also compile all of the files at once by running `make compile-all` which will compile each program and write all their executables to the currect directory.
